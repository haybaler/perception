## Implementation Roadmap and Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

The initial development phase focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure components that will support the entire URL scanning system. This includes setting up the Flask backend API with proper routing, middleware, and error handling mechanisms. The backend will implement a modular architecture where each analysis engine operates as an independent service component.

Database initialization involves creating the PostgreSQL schema with Supabase integration, implementing the multi-tenant data model, and establishing connection pooling for optimal performance. The database design includes tables for client management, URL analysis results, historical data, and system configuration settings.

Frontend scaffolding utilizes React with modern hooks and context management for state handling. The initial UI framework includes routing, authentication components, and basic layout structures that will accommodate the analysis dashboard and reporting interfaces.

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine Development

The second phase concentrates on developing the core analysis engines that perform the actual URL scanning and evaluation. Each engine operates independently and can be developed and tested in isolation, allowing for parallel development and easier maintenance.

The Technical Accessibility Engine implementation includes HTTP status code checking through direct requests, robots.txt parsing and analysis, sitemap discovery and validation, and CSS/JavaScript resource accessibility testing. This engine also implements the URL Inspection Tool simulation to verify how Google perceives the target pages.

The Core Web Vitals Engine integrates with Google PageSpeed Insights API and implements custom performance measurement tools. This engine calculates LCP, INP, and CLS metrics while providing detailed performance recommendations based on identified bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

The SEO Analysis Engine performs comprehensive on-page analysis including title tag optimization, meta description evaluation, header structure analysis, and content quality assessment. This engine also validates structured data implementation and checks for compliance with Google's helpful content guidelines.

### Phase 3: User Interface and Experience

The third development phase focuses on creating an intuitive and comprehensive user interface that effectively presents analysis results and recommendations. The dashboard implementation includes real-time progress tracking, visual metric displays, and interactive charts for trend analysis.

Results presentation features include detailed reporting with exportable formats, priority-based recommendation lists, and implementation guidance for identified issues. The interface supports both single URL analysis and batch processing workflows for enterprise users.

Mobile-responsive design ensures optimal user experience across all device types, with touch-friendly interfaces and adaptive layouts that maintain functionality and readability on smaller screens.

## API Specification and Endpoints

### Authentication and Client Management

The API implements token-based authentication with client identification through domain-based keys. Authentication endpoints include client registration, token generation, and session management capabilities.

```
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "organization": "Example Corp"
}

POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "secure_password"
}

GET /api/auth/profile
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Client management endpoints provide functionality for updating organization settings, managing team members, and configuring analysis preferences and notification settings.

### URL Analysis Endpoints

The core analysis functionality exposes RESTful endpoints for submitting URLs, tracking analysis progress, and retrieving results. The API supports both synchronous and asynchronous analysis modes depending on the complexity and number of URLs being processed.

```
POST /api/analyze/url
{
  "url": "https://example.com/page",
  "engines": ["technical", "performance", "seo", "mobile"],
  "priority": "normal"
}

GET /api/analyze/status/{analysis_id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}

GET /api/analyze/results/{analysis_id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Batch analysis endpoints enable processing multiple URLs simultaneously with progress tracking and result aggregation capabilities.

```
POST /api/analyze/batch
{
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2"
  ],
  "engines": ["technical", "performance", "seo"],
  "callback_url": "https://client.com/webhook"
}
```

### Results and Reporting Endpoints

Results retrieval endpoints provide flexible querying capabilities with filtering, sorting, and pagination support. The API enables clients to access historical data, trend analysis, and comparative reports across different time periods.

```
GET /api/results/history
?url=https://example.com
&start_date=2025-01-01
&end_date=2025-07-09
&engines=performance,seo

GET /api/results/export/{format}
?analysis_id={id}
&format=pdf|csv|json
```

Dashboard data endpoints provide aggregated metrics and summary information optimized for frontend visualization components.

### Webhook and Notification System

The API includes webhook capabilities for real-time notifications about analysis completion, significant changes in website performance, and system alerts. Clients can configure multiple webhook endpoints for different event types.

```
POST /api/webhooks/configure
{
  "events": ["analysis_complete", "performance_change"],
  "url": "https://client.com/webhook",
  "secret": "webhook_secret"
}
```

## Database Schema Implementation

### Core Tables and Relationships

The database schema implements a normalized structure optimized for both transactional operations and analytical queries. The client table serves as the foundation for multi-tenant data isolation, with domain-based primary keys ensuring secure data segregation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE clients (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    domain VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    organization VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE url_analyses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id),
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
    engines_requested TEXT[],
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Analysis results tables store detailed findings from each engine with JSON columns for flexible data storage and efficient querying capabilities.

```sql
CREATE TABLE analysis_results (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    analysis_id UUID REFERENCES url_analyses(id),
    engine VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    results JSONB NOT NULL,
    score INTEGER,
    recommendations JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Indexing and Performance Optimization

Strategic indexing implementation ensures optimal query performance for common access patterns including client-based filtering, URL lookups, and time-based queries for historical analysis.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_url_analyses_client_url ON url_analyses(client_id, url);
CREATE INDEX idx_url_analyses_created_at ON url_analyses(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_analysis_results_analysis_engine ON analysis_results(analysis_id, engine);
CREATE INDEX idx_analysis_results_score ON analysis_results(score) WHERE score IS NOT NULL;
```

Partitioning strategies for large datasets include time-based partitioning for historical data and client-based partitioning for multi-tenant isolation at the database level.

### Caching and Data Retention

The database implements intelligent caching strategies with configurable retention policies for different types of analysis data. Recent results receive aggressive caching while historical data follows archival policies based on client subscription levels and data retention requirements.

Cache invalidation logic considers content change detection, manual refresh requests, and time-based expiration to ensure data freshness while optimizing performance for frequently accessed URLs.
