# Google Search Console Best Practices Research

## Core Technical Requirements

Based on Google's official documentation, there are three fundamental technical requirements for pages to be eligible for Google Search indexing:

### 1. Googlebot isn't blocked (it can find and access the page)
- Google only indexes pages accessible to the public
- Pages must not block Googlebot crawler
- Private pages requiring login won't be crawled
- Pages blocked by robots.txt won't appear in search results
- Tools to check: Page Indexing report, Crawl Stats report, URL Inspection tool

### 2. The page works (it's not an error page)
- Google only indexes pages with HTTP 200 (success) status code
- Client and server error pages aren't indexed
- Can be checked with URL Inspection tool

### 3. The page has indexable content
- Textual content must be in supported file types
- Content must not violate spam policies
- Content must be meaningful and accessible

## Key Areas to Check in URL Scanner

Based on initial research, the URL scanner should check:

1. **Technical Accessibility**
   - HTTP status codes
   - Robots.txt compliance
   - Googlebot accessibility
   - Server response times

2. **Content Quality**
   - Indexable content presence
   - Content structure
   - Meta tags and descriptions
   - Title tags

3. **SEO Best Practices**
   - People-first content
   - Proper keyword usage
   - Crawlable links
   - Alt text for images

## Next Research Areas
- Core Web Vitals requirements
- Mobile-friendliness criteria
- Page experience signals
- Structured data requirements
- Security requirements (HTTPS)



## Core Web Vitals Metrics and Thresholds

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **Measures**: Loading performance
- **Good threshold**: LCP should occur within the first 2.5 seconds of page starting to load
- **What it measures**: How quickly the main content loads and renders

### 2. Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
- **Measures**: Responsiveness and interactivity
- **Good threshold**: INP of less than 200 milliseconds
- **What it measures**: How quickly the page responds to user interactions

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- **Measures**: Visual stability
- **Good threshold**: CLS score of less than 0.1
- **What it measures**: How much the page layout shifts during loading

## Page Experience Self-Assessment Questions

Google recommends answering "yes" to these questions for good page experience:

1. **Core Web Vitals**: Do your pages have good Core Web Vitals?
2. **Security**: Are your pages served in a secure fashion (HTTPS)?
3. **Mobile-friendliness**: Does your content display well on mobile devices?
4. **Ad experience**: Does your content avoid using an excessive amount of ads that distract from or interfere with the main content?
5. **Interstitials**: Do your pages avoid using intrusive interstitials?
6. **Content clarity**: Is your page designed so visitors can easily distinguish the main content from other content on your page?

## Key Page Experience Resources

- Core Web Vitals report in Search Console
- HTTPS security reports
- Mobile-friendly testing tools
- Chrome Lighthouse for comprehensive analysis
- Intrusive interstitials guidelines

## Important Notes

- **No single signal**: There is no single "page experience signal" - Google uses multiple signals
- **Page-specific evaluation**: Page experience is generally evaluated on a page-specific basis
- **Content relevance priority**: Google prioritizes relevant content even if page experience is sub-par
- **Holistic approach**: Focus on overall great page experience across many aspects, not just one or two


## Comprehensive Technical SEO Requirements

### Site Discovery and Indexing
1. **Site Search Operator Test**: Check if site appears in Google using `site:domain.com`
2. **Sitemap Submission**: Verify sitemap.xml exists and is properly formatted
3. **Robots.txt Compliance**: Check robots.txt doesn't block important content
4. **Internal Linking**: Ensure proper internal link structure for crawlability

### Technical Accessibility
1. **HTTP Status Codes**: All pages should return 200 status codes
2. **CSS and JavaScript Accessibility**: Google must be able to access CSS/JS resources
3. **Page Rendering**: Check if Google sees page same way as users
4. **Geographic Considerations**: Verify content visibility from different locations

### URL Structure and Organization
1. **Descriptive URLs**: URLs should contain meaningful words, not random identifiers
   - Good: `https://example.com/pets/cats.html`
   - Bad: `https://example.com/2/6772756D707920636174`
2. **Directory Organization**: Group topically similar pages in logical directories
3. **Breadcrumb Structure**: Implement proper breadcrumb navigation
4. **Canonical URLs**: Prevent duplicate content issues with proper canonicalization

### Content Quality and Structure
1. **Indexable Content**: Content must be in supported file formats
2. **Content Uniqueness**: Avoid duplicate content across pages
3. **Spam Policy Compliance**: Content must not violate Google's spam policies
4. **Content Accessibility**: Text content should be easily readable by crawlers

### Security Requirements
1. **HTTPS Implementation**: Pages should be served securely over HTTPS
2. **SSL Certificate Validity**: Ensure valid SSL certificates
3. **Mixed Content Issues**: Avoid mixing HTTP and HTTPS resources

### Structured Data and Markup
1. **Schema.org Implementation**: Use appropriate structured data markup
2. **JSON-LD Format**: Preferred format for structured data
3. **Rich Snippets Eligibility**: Proper markup for enhanced search results
4. **Validation**: Structured data should pass validation tests

### Additional Technical Factors
1. **Meta Tags**: Proper title tags and meta descriptions
2. **Alt Text**: Images should have descriptive alt attributes
3. **Link Quality**: Internal and external links should be crawlable
4. **Site Architecture**: Logical site structure and navigation
5. **Content Management**: Regular content updates and maintenance
